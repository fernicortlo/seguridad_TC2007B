# This code is a simple implementation of the One time pad cipher.
# It is a symetric key algorithm in which the key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
# The user must enter a plaintext and the code will return the encrypted text and the key used. 
# The key will be randomly generated.

# The alphabet used will be "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ", the space is included.
# This code uses the secrets module where some of the characters are non-printable characters.

import secrets

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '

#Function to generate a random key
def generate_key(length):
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(length))

# Function to do the XOR operation berween the plaintext and the key
def xor(text, key):
    result = ""
    #xor_op = 0
    for i in range(len(text)):
        xor_op= ord(text[i]) ^ ord(key[i])
        result += chr(xor_op)
    return result

# Function to cipher the text 
def encrypt(text, key):
    return xor(text,key)
